## Capstone-Specific Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| LLM hallucination in educational content | Faithfulness monitoring + curriculum grounding | — |
| Arabic language quality | Native speaker review + A/B testing | — |
| Math formula rendering failures | LaTeX validation + fallback to images | — |
| Cost overrun from LLM API calls | Budget alerts + caching + query deduplication | — |
| Student data privacy | Encryption + anonymization + compliance review | — |

## Notes

- This is the capstone — it should be the highest-quality release
- All prior project gates (auth-service, rag-system) should be referenced
- Consider a beta release to 10 students before full launch
- Post-launch monitoring is critical for the first 30 days
- This gate criteria may evolve as the project matures
