## Recommended Learning Order

The lectures are designed to be taken in order (01-10), as each builds on concepts from earlier lectures. However, you can also use them as standalone references.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Lectures 1-3)
Start here to understand the core attack vectors and basic defenses.

- **Lecture 1** — Understand how attackers manipulate AI inputs
- **Lecture 2** — Learn to detect and filter harmful content
- **Lecture 3** — Master input validation as the first line of defense

### Phase 2: Defense in Depth (Lectures 4-6)
Build layered protections around your AI systems.

- **Lecture 4** — Filter and sanitize AI outputs before they reach users
- **Lecture 5** — Protect user data and maintain privacy compliance
- **Lecture 6** — Control who can access your AI systems and what they can do

### Phase 3: System Security (Lectures 7-9)
Secure the infrastructure that runs your AI systems.

- **Lecture 7** — Protect your APIs from common attack patterns
- **Lecture 8** — Defend your models against adversarial manipulation
- **Lecture 9** — Harden your infrastructure and deployment pipeline

### Phase 4: Operational Security (Lecture 10)
Monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents.

- **Lecture 10** — Build observability and incident response capabilities

## How to Use Lectures + Glossaries Together

1. **First Pass**: Read the lecture for deep understanding. Highlight terms you don't know.
2. **Glossary Lookup**: After reading each lecture, review the companion glossary to solidify definitions.
3. **Code Along**: Type out and run the code examples yourself. Modify them to test edge cases.
4. **Practice Exercises**: Complete the exercises at the end of each lecture before moving on.
5. **Quick Reference**: Use glossary files as quick reference cards when working on real projects.

### Study Technique: Lecture + Glossary Pairing

```
For each topic:
  1. Read the lecture (30-45 min)
  2. Review the glossary (10-15 min)
  3. Complete practice exercises (30-60 min)
  4. Re-read glossary for terms you struggled with (5 min)
  5. Move to next topic
```
