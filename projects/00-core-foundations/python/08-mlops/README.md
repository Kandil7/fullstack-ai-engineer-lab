# Phase 8 — MLOps: Production Machine Learning

The bridge from trained models to production systems: reproducibility,
tracking, versioning, serving, monitoring, and the full deployment lifecycle.

## Lectures

Every topic has a **full-detail lecture** (`lectures/NN-topic-lecture.md`) and
a **glossary** (`lectures/NN-topic-glossary.md`). Each lecture covers the
complete topic, every use case, and real-world scenarios for AI engineers in
production.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 7 Machine Learning (`07-machine-learning/`)
- Python + NumPy + pandas + scikit-learn

## Running

```bash
python 01-reproducibility.py            # run one exercise
python run_smoke_tests.py --phase 8     # run the whole phase
pytest tests/unit/test_mlops.py -q      # unit tests
```

## Production Path

The capstone (`16-case-study-e2e.py` + lecture) walks one model release
through all 15 practices — the template for any production ML system.
