# DSA Graphs Interview Practice

## Topic Overview

Graphs model relationships between entities. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). Graph problems test your understanding of **traversal** (BFS/DFS), **shortest path** algorithms, **connectivity**, and **topological ordering**.

**Graph Representations:**
- **Adjacency list:** `graph = {A: [B, C], B: [A, D]}` — most common, space O(V+E)
- **Adjacency matrix:** `graph[i][j] = 1 if edge` — space O(V²), faster edge lookup
- **Edge list:** `[(A,B), (B,C)]` — compact, good for Kruskal's

**Graph Types:**
- **Directed vs Undirected**
- **Weighted vs Unweighted**
- **Cyclic vs Acyclic (DAG)**
- **Connected vs Disconnected**
- **Complete:** Every vertex connected to every other

**Time/Space for Representations:**
| Operation | Adjacency List | Adjacency Matrix |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Space | O(V + E) | O(V²) |
| Check edge | O(degree) | O(1) |
| List neighbors | O(degree) | O(V) |
| Add edge | O(1) | O(1) |
| Remove edge | O(degree) | O(1) |

## Interview Questions (with Answers)

### Q1: Explain BFS and DFS. When would you use each?

**Answer:**
**BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Explores layer by layer using a queue.
- Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Level-order traversal
- Checking connectivity

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([start])
    order = []

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        order.append(node)

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return order
```

**DFS (Depth-First Search):** Explores as deep as possible before backtracking using a stack (or recursion).
- Cycle detection
- Topological sort
- Finding connected components
- Path existence

```python
def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    order = []

    def dfs_helper(node):
        visited.add(node)
        order.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs_helper(neighbor)

    dfs_helper(start)
    return order

# Iterative DFS
def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    order = []

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            order.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)

    return order
```

**When to use which:**
- BFS: Shortest path (unweighted), level-order, closest neighbor
- DFS: Cycle detection, path finding, topological sort, connected components

---

### Q2: How do you detect a cycle in a directed graph?

**Answer:**
DFS with coloring: WHITE (unvisited), GRAY (in progress), BLACK (finished).

```python
def has_cycle_directed(graph):
    WHITE, GRAY, BLACK = 0, 1, 2
    color = {node: WHITE for node in graph}

    def dfs(node):
        color[node] = GRAY
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if color[neighbor] == GRAY:
                return True  # Back edge found
            if color[neighbor] == WHITE and dfs(neighbor):
                return True
        color[node] = BLACK
        return False

    for node in graph:
        if color[node] == WHITE:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False
```

**For undirected graphs:** Track parent. If you visit a visited node that's not the parent, there's a cycle.

```python
def has_cycle_undirected(graph):
    visited = set()

    def dfs(node, parent):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                if dfs(neighbor, node):
                    return True
            elif neighbor != parent:
                return True
        return False

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            if dfs(node, -1):
                return True
    return False
```

---

### Q3: What is topological sort? When is it used?

**Answer:**
Topological sort orders vertices in a DAG so that for every directed edge (u, v), u comes before v.

**Applications:**
- Task scheduling with dependencies
- Course prerequisites
- Build systems (Makefile)
- Spreadsheet formula evaluation

**DFS-based (O(V + E)):**
```python
def topological_sort_dfs(graph):
    visited = set()
    order = []

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
        order.append(node)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)

    return order[::-1]

# Test
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D'],
    'C': ['D'],
    'D': []
}
assert topological_sort_dfs(graph) in [
    ['A', 'C', 'B', 'D'],
    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
]
```

**Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based, O(V + E)):**
```python
from collections import deque

def topological_sort_kahn(graph):
    in_degree = {node: 0 for node in graph}
    for node in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] += 1

    queue = deque([node for node in graph if in_degree[node] == 0])
    order = []

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        order.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    if len(order) != len(graph):
        return []  # Cycle exists
    return order
```

---

### Q4: Explain Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Answer:**
Dijkstra's finds the shortest path from a source to all vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    heap = [(0, start)]
    previous = {node: None for node in graph}

    while heap:
        curr_dist, node = heapq.heappop(heap)

        if curr_dist > distances[node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            distance = curr_dist + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                previous[neighbor] = node
                heapq.heappush(heap, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances, previous

# Test
graph = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],
    'B': [('A', 1), ('C', 2), ('D', 5)],
    'C': [('A', 4), ('B', 2), ('D', 1)],
    'D': [('B', 5), ('C', 1)]
}
distances, previous = dijkstra(graph, 'A')
assert distances == {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 3, 'D': 4}
```

**Time: O((V + E) log V)** with binary heap, **O(V²)** with array.

---

### Q5: How do you find connected components in a graph?

**Answer:**
```python
def connected_components(graph):
    visited = set()
    components = []

    def dfs(node, component):
        visited.add(node)
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor, component)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            component = []
            dfs(node, component)
            components.append(component)

    return components

# Test
graph = {
    'A': ['B'],
    'B': ['A'],
    'C': ['D'],
    'D': ['C'],
    'E': []
}
assert connected_components(graph) == [['A', 'B'], ['C', 'D'], ['E']]
```

---

### Q6: What is Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)?

**Answer:**
Union-Find tracks elements partitioned into disjoint sets. Supports:
- `find(x)`: Find which set x belongs to
- `union(x, y)`: Merge sets containing x and y

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        # Union by rank
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            px, py = py, px
        self.parent[py] = px
        if self.rank[px] == self.rank[py]:
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True

    def connected(self, x, y):
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)
```

**Time: O(α(n))** amortized (α is inverse Ackermann, nearly constant).

**Applications:** Kruskal's MST, detecting cycles, dynamic connectivity.

---

### Q7: How do you find the minimum spanning tree?

**Answer:**
**Kruskal's Algorithm (O(E log E)):**
```python
def kruskal(n, edges):
    # edges: list of (weight, u, v)
    edges.sort()
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    mst = []

    for weight, u, v in edges:
        if uf.union(u, v):
            mst.append((weight, u, v))
            if len(mst) == n - 1:
                break

    return mst
```

**Prim's Algorithm (O(E log V)):**
```python
import heapq

def prim(graph, start=0):
    mst = []
    visited = set()
    heap = [(0, start, -1)]  # (weight, node, parent)

    while heap and len(mst) < len(graph):
        weight, node, parent = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        if parent != -1:
            mst.append((weight, parent, node))

        for neighbor, w in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (w, neighbor, node))

    return mst
```

---

### Q8: How do you find the shortest path in an unweighted graph?

**Answer:**
BFS gives the shortest path:

```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    visited = set([start])

    while queue:
        node, path = queue.popleft()
        if node == end:
            return path

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    return []  # No path
```

---

### Q9: What is Bellman-Ford algorithm?

**Answer:**
Finds shortest paths from source, handles negative weights (but not negative cycles).

```python
def bellman_ford(n, edges, start):
    distances = [float('inf')] * n
    distances[start] = 0

    for _ in range(n - 1):
        for u, v, w in edges:
            if distances[u] + w < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + w

    # Check for negative cycle
    for u, v, w in edges:
        if distances[u] + w < distances[v]:
            return None  # Negative cycle exists

    return distances
```

**Time: O(V * E)**

---

### Q10: How do you detect a negative cycle?

**Answer:**
Run Bellman-Ford for V iterations. If any distance still decreases in the V-th iteration, there's a negative cycle.

```python
def has_negative_cycle(n, edges, start):
    distances = [float('inf')] * n
    distances[start] = 0

    for _ in range(n - 1):
        for u, v, w in edges:
            if distances[u] + w < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + w

    for u, v, w in edges:
        if distances[u] + w < distances[v]:
            return True

    return False
```

---

### Q11: How do you find all paths from source to destination?

**Answer:**
```python
def find_all_paths(graph, start, end):
    result = []

    def dfs(node, path):
        if node == end:
            result.append(path[:])
            return
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in path:
                path.append(neighbor)
                dfs(neighbor, path)
                path.pop()

    dfs(start, [start])
    return result

# Test
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['E'],
    'D': [],
    'E': []
}
assert find_all_paths(graph, 'A', 'E') == [['A', 'B', 'E'], ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E'], ['A', 'C', 'E']]
```

---

### Q12: How do you implement a course schedule (topological sort application)?

**Answer:**
```python
from collections import deque

def can_finish(num_courses, prerequisites):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(num_courses)]
    in_degree = [0] * num_courses

    for course, prereq in prerequisites:
        graph[prereq].append(course)
        in_degree[course] += 1

    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degree[i] == 0])
    count = 0

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return count == num_courses

# Test
assert can_finish(2, [[1, 0]]) == True
assert can_finish(2, [[1, 0], [0, 1]]) == False
```

### Q13: How do you find bridges in a graph?

**Answer:**
An edge is a bridge if removing it disconnects the graph. Uses Tarjan's algorithm.

```python
def find_bridges(n, edges):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    disc = [-1] * n
    low = [-1] * n
    bridges = []
    timer = [0]

    def dfs(u, parent):
        disc[u] = low[u] = timer[0]
        timer[0] += 1

        for v in graph[u]:
            if disc[v] == -1:
                dfs(v, u)
                low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])
                if low[v] > disc[u]:
                    bridges.append((u, v))
            elif v != parent:
                low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

    for i in range(n):
        if disc[i] == -1:
            dfs(i, -1)

    return bridges
```

### Q14: What is the difference between BFS and DFS in terms of memory?

**Answer:**
| Aspect | BFS | DFS |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Data structure | Queue | Stack (or recursion) |
| Memory | O(V) worst case (wide tree) | O(V) worst case (deep tree) |
| Shortest path | Yes (unweighted) | No |
| Complete | Yes | Yes (with visited set) |
| Time | O(V + E) | O(V + E) |

**Memory trade-off:** BFS uses more memory for wide graphs. DFS uses more for deep graphs (recursion stack).

### Q15: How do you find the number of islands?

**Answer:**
```python
def num_islands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    count = 0

    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] != '1':
            return
        grid[r][c] = '0'  # Mark visited
        dfs(r + 1, c)
        dfs(r - 1, c)
        dfs(r, c + 1)
        dfs(r, c - 1)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == '1':
                dfs(r, c)
                count += 1

    return count

# Test
grid = [
    ['1','1','1','1','0'],
    ['1','1','0','1','0'],
    ['1','1','0','0','0'],
    ['0','0','0','0','0']
]
assert num_islands(grid) == 1

## Common Follow-Up Questions

1. **"What if the graph is very large?"** — Use BFS/DFS with visited set. Consider iterative DFS to avoid stack overflow.
2. **"What about weighted edges?"** — Use Dijkstra (non-negative) or Bellman-Ford (negative weights).
3. **"Can you do it in O(1) space?"** — Usually no for graph traversal, but you can modify the input graph.
4. **"What if the graph has cycles?"** — Use visited set to avoid infinite loops. For directed, use coloring.
5. **"How would you store the graph?"** — Adjacency list for sparse graphs, matrix for dense.

## Tips for Answering Graph Questions

1. **Choose the right representation:** Adjacency list is usually best.
2. **Use a visited set:** Prevents infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
3. **Think about the traversal pattern:** BFS for shortest path, DFS for exhaustive search.
4. **Handle disconnected graphs:** Loop through all nodes.
5. **Consider edge cases:** Single node, empty graph, complete graph.
6. **Know the algorithms:** Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal, Prim.
