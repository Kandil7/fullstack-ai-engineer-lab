## Interview Questions

### Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

**Q1: Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Give examples of each.** 🟢

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Data | Labeled (input + output) | Unlabeled (input only) |
| Goal | Predict output from input | Find hidden patterns |
| Evaluation | Compare to ground truth | No ground truth |
| Examples | Classification, Regression | Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction |

**Supervised Learning Examples:**
- Email spam detection (spam/not spam)
- House price prediction (regression)
- Image classification (cat/dog/bird)

**Unsupervised Learning Examples:**
- Customer segmentation (grouping similar customers)
- Anomaly detection (finding unusual transactions)
- Topic modeling (discovering document topics)

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  # Supervised
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans  # Unsupervised

# Supervised: X (features) and y (labels) both provided
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Unsupervised: Only X provided, no labels
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
```

**Follow-up:** "When would you use semi-supervised learning?"
- When you have lots of unlabeled data but labeling is expensive
- Medical imaging (few labeled scans, many unlabeled)
- When labeled data is insufficient for supervised learning

---

**Q2: What is the bias-variance tradeoff?** 🔴

**Answer:**
The bias-variance tradeoff explains why models make errors:

- **Bias** (Underfitting): Model is too simple, misses patterns
  - High training error
  - High test error
  - Example: Using linear regression for non-linear data

- **Variance** (Overfitting): Model is too complex, memorizes noise
  - Low training error
  - High test error
  - Example: Deep decision tree that memorizes training data

- **Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error**

```
Model Complexity →
Low  ─────────────────────────── High
High Bias                High Variance
(Underfitting)           (Overfitting)

Optimal Model: Where total error is minimized
```

**Visual:**
```
Error
  │
  │    ╲  Training Error
  │     ╲─────────────────
  │      ╲
  │       ╲   ╱ Test Error
  │        ╲ ╱
  │         ╳  ← Optimal complexity
  │        ╱ ╲
  │       ╱   ╲
  └───────────────────── Model Complexity
```

**Follow-up:** "How do you reduce bias? How do you reduce variance?"
- Reduce bias: More complex model, more features, less regularization
- Reduce variance: More data, simpler model, regularization, ensemble methods

---

**Q3: What is cross-validation and why is it important?** 🟡

**Answer:**
Cross-validation estimates model performance on unseen data by splitting data into multiple train/test sets:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np

# K-Fold Cross Validation
kfold = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

# Get scores for each fold
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=kfold, scoring='accuracy')
print(f"Scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean: {scores.mean():.4f} ± {scores.std():.4f}")

# Stratified K-Fold (for imbalanced classes)
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
skfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=skfold, scoring='f1')
```

**Why important:**
1. More reliable performance estimate than single train/test split
2. Uses all data for both training and validation
3. Reduces variance in performance estimate
4. Helps detect overfitting

**Types:**
- K-Fold: Split into K equal parts
- Stratified K-Fold: Maintains class distribution
- Leave-One-Out: K = n (expensive)
- Time Series Split: Respects temporal ordering

---

**Q4: Explain the difference between classification and regression.** 🟢

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Classification | Regression |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Output | Discrete class labels | Continuous values |
| Examples | Spam/not spam, cat/dog | Price, temperature, sales |
| Metrics | Accuracy, F1, AUC | MSE, RMSE, R² |
| Algorithms | Logistic Regression, SVM, Trees | Linear Regression, Ridge, Trees |

```python
# Classification
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y = [0, 1, 1, 0, ...]
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y = [12.5, 23.0, 45.2, ...]
y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

---

### Linear Regression

**Q5: Explain how linear regression works. What are its assumptions?** 🟡

**Answer:**
Linear regression finds the best linear relationship between features (X) and target (y):

**Mathematical formulation:**
```
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε

Where:
- β₀ = intercept (bias)
- β₁...βₙ = coefficients (weights)
- ε = error term
```

**Assumptions:**
1. **Linearity**: Relationship between X and y is linear
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals
4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed
5. **No multicollinearity**: Features are not highly correlated

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# Simple linear regression
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_}")
print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_}")

predictions = model.predict(X)
mse = mean_squared_error(y, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y, predictions)

print(f"MSE: {mse:.4f}")
print(f"R²: {r2:.4f}")
```

**When to use:**
- Target is continuous
- Linear relationship exists
- Interpretability is important
- Baseline model for comparison

---

**Q6: What is regularization and when do you use it?** 🟡

**Answer:**
Regularization prevents overfitting by penalizing large coefficients:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet

# No regularization (can overfit)
linear = LinearRegression()
linear.fit(X_train, y_train)

# L2 Regularization (Ridge) - Shrinks coefficients
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)  # alpha controls regularization strength
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)

# L1 Regularization (Lasso) - Can zero out coefficients (feature selection)
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Elastic Net - Combines L1 and L2
elastic = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)
elastic.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

| Type | Penalty | Effect | Use When |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| Ridge (L2) | Σβᵢ² | Shrinks all coefficients | Many features, all relevant |
| Lasso (L1) | Σ|βᵢ| | Can zero out coefficients | Feature selection needed |
| Elastic Net | L1 + L2 | Balanced approach | Many correlated features |

**Choosing alpha:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'alpha': [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]}
grid = GridSearchCV(Ridge(), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='r2')
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best alpha: {grid.best_params_['alpha']}")
```

---

### Logistic Regression

**Q7: Explain logistic regression. How does it differ from linear regression?** 🟡

**Answer:**
Logistic regression predicts probabilities for classification tasks:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss, roc_auc_score

# Linear Regression: y = β₀ + β₁x (continuous output)
# Logistic Regression: p(y=1) = sigmoid(β₀ + β₁x) (probability output)

# Sigmoid function maps any value to (0, 1)
def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

# Example
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict probabilities
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
log_loss_score = log_loss(y_test, probabilities)
auc_score = roc_auc_score(y_test, probabilities)
```

**Key differences from linear regression:**
| Aspect | Linear Regression | Logistic Regression |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Output | Continuous (-∞, +∞) | Probability (0, 1) |
| Loss Function | MSE | Log Loss (Cross-Entropy) |
| Decision Boundary | N/A | Linear |
| Use Case | Regression | Classification |

---

**Q8: How do you handle imbalanced datasets in classification?** 🔴

**Answer:**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, classification_report
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# 1. Resampling techniques
# Oversampling minority class
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Undersampling majority class
undersampler = RandomUnderSampler(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = undersampler.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# 2. Class weights
model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Evaluation metrics (accuracy is misleading for imbalanced data)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Use F1 instead of accuracy
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')
```

**Metrics for imbalanced data:**
- **Precision**: Of all positive predictions, how many are correct?
- **Recall**: Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under the ROC curve

---

### Decision Trees

**Q9: Explain how decision trees work. What are their pros and cons?** 🟡

**Answer:**
Decision trees recursively split data based on feature values to minimize impurity:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_text
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Create and train decision tree
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(
    max_depth=3,           # Limit tree depth
    min_samples_split=10,  # Minimum samples to split a node
    min_samples_leaf=5,    # Minimum samples in leaf node
    random_state=42
)
tree.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Visualize tree structure
print(export_text(tree, feature_names=feature_names))

# Feature importance
importance = tree.feature_importances_
for name, imp in sorted(zip(feature_names, importance), key=lambda x: -x[1]):
    print(f"{name}: {imp:.4f}")
```

**Splitting criteria:**
| Criterion | Formula | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Gini Impurity | 1 - Σpᵢ² | Default, faster |
| Entropy | -Σpᵢ log(pᵢ) | Slightly more balanced trees |

**Pros:**
- Easy to understand and visualize
- No feature scaling required
- Handles both numerical and categorical
- Captures non-linear relationships

**Cons:**
- Prone to overfitting
- Unstable (small data changes = different tree)
- Biased toward features with more levels
- Greedy algorithm (not globally optimal)

---

**Q10: How do random forests improve upon decision trees?** 🟡

**Answer:**
Random forests combine multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
import numpy as np

# Single decision tree (prone to overfitting)
single_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
single_scores = cross_val_score(single_tree, X, y, cv=5)

# Random forest (reduces overfitting)
rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,    # Number of trees
    max_depth=10,        # Limit depth
    max_features='sqrt', # Features per split (random subset)
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1            # Use all CPU cores
)
rf_scores = cross_val_score(rf, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Single tree: {single_scores.mean():.4f} ± {single_scores.std():.4f}")
print(f"Random forest: {rf_scores.mean():.4f} ± {rf_scores.std():.4f}")

# Feature importance
rf.fit(X, y)
importance = rf.feature_importances_
```

**Key differences:**
| Aspect | Decision Tree | Random Forest |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Overfitting | High | Low |
| Variance | High | Low |
| Interpretability | High | Moderate |
| Training Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Prediction Speed | Fast | Moderate |

**Why it works:**
1. **Bagging**: Each tree trained on different data subset
2. **Feature randomness**: Each split uses random feature subset
3. **Ensemble**: Reduces variance through averaging

---

### K-Means Clustering

**Q11: Explain the K-Means algorithm. What are its limitations?** 🟡

**Answer:**
K-Means groups data into K clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
import numpy as np

# Basic K-Means
kmeans = KMeans(
    n_clusters=3,
    init='k-means++',  # Smart initialization
    n_init=10,         # Run 10 times, pick best
    random_state=42
)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Evaluate with silhouette score
sil_score = silhouette_score(X, clusters)
print(f"Silhouette Score: {sil_score:.4f}")

# Find optimal K using elbow method
inertias = []
K_range = range(2, 11)
for k in K_range:
    km = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    km.fit(X)
    inertias.append(km.inertia_)

# Plot elbow curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(K_range, inertias, 'bo-')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters (K)')
plt.ylabel('Inertia')
plt.title('Elbow Method')
plt.show()
```

**Algorithm steps:**
1. Initialize K centroids randomly (or K-Means++)
2. Assign each point to nearest centroid
3. Update centroids as mean of assigned points
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence

**Limitations:**
- Assumes spherical clusters
- Must specify K in advance
- Sensitive to initialization
- Struggles with varying cluster sizes
- Not suitable for non-convex shapes

**When to use:**
- Clusters are roughly spherical
- You know the number of clusters
- Data is not too high-dimensional
- Need fast, scalable clustering

---

**Q12: How do you determine the optimal number of clusters?** 🟡

**Answer:**

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, calinski_harabasz_score
import numpy as np

def find_optimal_clusters(X, max_k=10):
    """Find optimal K using multiple methods"""
    results = {
        'k': [],
        'inertia': [],
        'silhouette': [],
        'calinski': []
    }

    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):
        kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
        labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

        results['k'].append(k)
        results['inertia'].append(kmeans.inertia_)
        results['silhouette'].append(silhouette_score(X, labels))
        results['calinski'].append(calinski_harabasz_score(X, labels))

    return results

# Elbow method: Look for "elbow" in inertia plot
# Silhouette: Higher is better (max is 1)
# Calinski-Harabasz: Higher is better

results = find_optimal_clusters(X)
optimal_k = results['k'][np.argmax(results['silhouette'])]
print(f"Optimal K (silhouette): {optimal_k}")
```

**Methods:**
1. **Elbow Method**: Plot inertia vs K, look for bend
2. **Silhouette Score**: Measures cluster cohesion vs separation
3. **Gap Statistic**: Compares within-cluster dispersion to null reference
4. **Calinski-Harabasz**: Ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance

---

### Model Evaluation

**Q13: Explain precision, recall, and F1-score. When do you prioritize each?** 🟡

**Answer:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import (
    confusion_matrix, classification_report,
    precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
)

# Confusion Matrix
#                    Predicted
#                   Neg    Pos
# Actual Neg  [  TN  |  FP  ]
#        Pos  [  FN  |  TP  ]

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Confusion Matrix:\n{cm}")

# Metrics
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)  # TP / (TP + FP)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)        # TP / (TP + FN)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)               # 2 * (P * R) / (P + R)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

**When to prioritize:**
| Metric | Priority | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Precision** | When FP is costly | Email spam (don't mark important emails as spam) |
| **Recall** | When FN is costly | Cancer detection (don't miss positive cases) |
| **F1-Score** | Balance both | General classification with imbalanced classes |
| **Accuracy** | When classes balanced | Overall performance metric |

**Formula:**
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)  → "Of all predicted positives, how many are correct?"
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)     → "Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?"
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

---

**Q14: What is AUC-ROC and why is it useful?** 🟡

**Answer:**
AUC-ROC measures model performance across all classification thresholds:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, roc_auc_score, auc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Get predicted probabilities
y_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Calculate ROC curve
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_proba)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

# Plot ROC curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='blue', label=f'ROC Curve (AUC = {roc_auc:.4f})')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='red', linestyle='--', label='Random Classifier')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('ROC Curve')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

print(f"AUC Score: {roc_auc:.4f}")
```

**Interpretation:**
- AUC = 1.0: Perfect classifier
- AUC = 0.5: Random classifier (no better than guessing)
- AUC < 0.5: Worse than random

**Why useful:**
- Threshold-independent
- Handles imbalanced classes better than accuracy
- Single number summary of model performance

---

**Q15: Explain cross-validation and why it's better than a single train/test split.** 🟡

**Answer:**
Cross-validation provides more reliable performance estimates:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate, StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
import numpy as np

# Single split: High variance in estimate
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
model = GradientBoostingClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
single_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)

# Cross-validation: More reliable estimate
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
scores = cross_validate(
    model, X, y,
    cv=cv,
    scoring=['accuracy', 'f1_weighted'],
    return_train_score=True
)

print(f"Single split accuracy: {single_score:.4f}")
print(f"CV accuracy: {scores['test_accuracy'].mean():.4f} ± {scores['test_accuracy'].std():.4f}")
print(f"CV F1: {scores['test_f1_weighted'].mean():.4f} ± {scores['test_f1_weighted'].std():.4f}")
```

**Advantages over single split:**
1. Uses all data for both training and validation
2. Reduces variance in performance estimate
3. Detects overfitting better
4. More reliable model selection

---

### Overfitting and Underfitting

**Q16: How do you detect and prevent overfitting?** 🔴

**Answer:**

**Detection:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve
import numpy as np

def plot_learning_curve(estimator, X, y):
    train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores = learning_curve(
        estimator, X, y, cv=5,
        train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10),
        scoring='accuracy'
    )

    train_mean = train_scores.mean(axis=1)
    train_std = train_scores.std(axis=1)
    val_mean = val_scores.mean(axis=1)
    val_std = val_scores.std(axis=1)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(train_sizes, train_mean, label='Training score')
    plt.plot(train_sizes, val_mean, label='Cross-validation score')
    plt.fill_between(train_sizes, train_mean - train_std, train_mean + train_std, alpha=0.1)
    plt.fill_between(train_sizes, val_mean - val_std, val_mean + val_std, alpha=0.1)
    plt.xlabel('Training Examples')
    plt.ylabel('Score')
    plt.title('Learning Curve')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Overfitting signs:
# - High training score, low validation score
# - Large gap between train and validation curves
# - Validation score plateaus or decreases
```

**Prevention techniques:**
1. **Regularization** (L1/L2)
2. **Cross-validation** for model selection
3. **Early stopping** (for iterative algorithms)
4. **Feature selection** (reduce dimensionality)
5. **Ensemble methods** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
6. **More training data**
7. **Data augmentation**
8. **Dropout** (for neural networks)

---

**Q17: What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?** 🟡

**Answer:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet

# L1 Regularization (Lasso)
# Penalty: λ × Σ|βᵢ|
# Effect: Can shrink coefficients to exactly 0 (feature selection)
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Lasso coefficients: {lasso.coef_}")
print(f"Non-zero features: {np.sum(lasso.coef_ != 0)}")

# L2 Regularization (Ridge)
# Penalty: λ × Σβᵢ²
# Effect: Shrinks coefficients but never to 0
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Ridge coefficients: {ridge.coef_}")

# Elastic Net (combines L1 and L2)
elastic = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)
elastic.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

| Aspect | L1 (Lasso) | L2 (Ridge) |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Penalty | Sum of absolute values | Sum of squared values |
| Feature Selection | Yes (zeros out coefficients) | No (shrinks but keeps all) |
| Correlated Features | Keeps one, zeros others | Distributes weight |
| Use Case | Feature selection needed | All features relevant |

---

### Feature Engineering

**Q18: What are common feature engineering techniques?** 🟡

**Answer:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder

# 1. Numerical Features
# Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Log transform (for skewed distributions)
df['log_price'] = np.log1p(df['price'])

# Binning (convert continuous to categorical)
df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=[0, 18, 35, 60, 100],

   - "What's the evaluation metric?"

2. **Start Simple**
   - Propose a baseline first
   - Show you understand fundamentals
   - Then suggest improvements

3. **Discuss Tradeoffs**
   - Model complexity vs interpretability
   - Training time vs accuracy
   - Feature engineering effort vs performance

4. **Explain Your Reasoning**
