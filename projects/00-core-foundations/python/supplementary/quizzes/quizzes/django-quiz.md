## Questions

### Question 1 [Easy]
**What is Django primarily used for?**

A) Data analysis
B) Building web applications
C) Machine learning
D) Desktop applications

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Django is a high-level Python web framework for building secure, maintainable web applications. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, called MVT in Django.

---

### Question 2 [Easy]
**What does MVT stand for in Django?**

A) Model-View-Template
B) Model-View-Controller
C) Module-View-Template
D) Model-View-Transaction

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Django uses the MVT pattern: Models (data), Views (business logic), and Templates (presentation). It's similar to MVC but with templates instead of views.

---

### Question 3 [Easy]
**How do you create a new Django project?**

A) `django-admin startproject project_name`
B) `django create project_name`
C) `django init project_name`
D) `pip install django`

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `django-admin startproject` creates a new Django project with the standard directory structure. Then use `python manage.py startapp` to create apps within it.

---

### Question 4 [Easy]
**What is a Django app?**

A) A mobile application
B) A modular component that handles specific functionality
C) The main project
D) A template file

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Django apps are modular components that handle specific features (e.g., blog, authentication, payments). A project contains multiple apps, each with its own models, views, and URLs.

---

### Question 5 [Medium]
**How do you define a model in Django?**

A) By creating a class that inherits from `django.db.models.Model`
B) By writing SQL directly
C) By creating a JSON file
D) By using decorators

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Django models are Python classes that inherit from `Model`. Each class attribute represents a database field, and Django automatically creates the database table.

```python
from django.db import models

class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

---

### Question 6 [Medium]
**What does `python manage.py migrate` do?**

A) Moves files to production
B) Applies database migrations to create/update tables
C) Backs up the database
D) Transfers data between databases

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `migrate` applies pending migrations to the database, creating tables and modifying schema. Always run `makemigrations` first to create migration files.

---

### Question 7 [Medium]
**What is the purpose of `urls.py` in Django?**

A) To configure database connections
B) To map URLs to views
C) To define models
D) To create templates

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `urls.py` defines URL patterns that map URL paths to view functions. Django uses the `urlpatterns` list with `path()` or `re_path()` functions.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('articles/', views.article_list, name='article_list'),
    path('articles/<int:pk>/', views.article_detail, name='article_detail'),
]
```

---

### Question 8 [Easy]
**What is the Django admin interface?**

A) A command-line tool
B) A built-in web interface for managing data
C) A database management tool
D) A file manager

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Django provides a built-in admin interface that automatically generates a web-based UI for managing your data. It's highly customizable and great for content management.

---

### Question 9 [Medium]
**How do you create a superuser in Django?**

A) `python manage.py createsuperuser`
B) `python manage.py createadmin`
C) `python manage.py adduser`
D) `python manage.py superuser`

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `createsuperuser` creates an admin user with full permissions. You'll be prompted for username, email, and password. This user can access the admin interface.

---

### Question 10 [Medium]
**What is the Django ORM?**

A) Object-Relational Mapping for database operations
B) Online Resource Manager
C) Output Rendering Module
D) Object Request Mapper

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) lets you interact with the database using Python objects instead of raw SQL. It supports multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).

---

### Question 11 [Easy]
**What does `python manage.py runserver` do?**

A) Runs the production server
B) Starts the development server
C) Compiles the project
D) Runs database migrations

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `runserver` starts Django's lightweight development server (default port 8000). It auto-reloads on code changes. Never use it in production.

---

### Question 12 [Medium]
**What is a Django template?**

A) A database schema
B) An HTML file with template tags for dynamic content
C) A Python script
D) A CSS file

**Correct Answer:** B

---

### Question 13 [Medium]
**How do you render a template in a view?**

A) `return render(request, 'template.html', context)`
B) `return template('template.html')`
C) `return HttpResponse(template)`

**What is middleware in Django?**

A) Software that processes requests/responses globally
B) Database middleware
C) Template middleware
D) File middleware

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django's request/response processing. It can do security checks, session management, CSRF protection, and more.

---

### Question 16 [Easy]
**How do you create a Django app?**

A) `python manage.py startapp app_name`
B) `django-admin startapp app_name`
C) Both A and B
D) `python manage.py createapp app_name`

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Both commands create a new Django app. `manage.py startapp` is used within a project, while `django-admin startapp` can create standalone apps.

---

### Question 17 [Medium]
**What is the purpose of `models.py` in a Django app?**

A) To define the database schema
B) To handle HTTP requests
C) To create templates
D) To configure URLs

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `models.py` defines your data models as Python classes. Each model maps to a database table, and fields define columns with types and constraints.

---

### Question 18 [Medium]
**What is Django REST Framework (DRF)?**

A) A library for building REST APIs with Django
B) A framework for RESTful services
C) Both A and B
D) A testing framework

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Django REST Framework is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs. It provides serializers, viewsets, authentication, and browsable API interface.

---

### Question 19 [Hard]
**What is `select_related()` used for in Django ORM?**

A) Selecting related objects efficiently with JOIN
B) Selecting database tables
C) Filtering related data
D) Joining strings

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `select_related()` performs a SQL JOIN to fetch related objects in a single query, preventing the N+1 query problem. Use it for ForeignKey and OneToOneField relationships.

---

### Question 20 [Medium]
**What does `python manage.py shell` do?**

A) Opens a Python shell with Django environment loaded
B) Opens a system shell
C) Runs a script
D) Compiles the project
