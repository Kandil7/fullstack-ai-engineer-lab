## Questions

### Question 1 [Medium]
**What is the difference between `arr[0:5]` and `arr.take([0,1,2,3,4])`?**

A) No difference
B) `take()` is always faster
C) `take()` works on flattened array, slicing preserves shape
D) Slicing creates a copy

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Slicing preserves the original shape and creates a view. `take()` works on the flattened array by default and creates a copy. `take()` can be faster for fancy indexing operations.

### Question 2 [Hard]
**What is "fancy indexing" in NumPy?**

A) Indexing with boolean arrays
B) Indexing with integer arrays
C) Using `.fancy[]` method
D) Indexing with string labels

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Fancy indexing uses integer arrays to select elements. You pass an array of indices, and NumPy returns an array of elements at those positions.

```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices = np.array([0, 2, 4])
arr[indices]  # [10, 30, 50]
```

### Question 3 [Hard]
**What does `np.einsum()` do?**

A) Eigenvalue decomposition
B) Einstein summation notation for array operations
C) Exponential sum
D) Element-wise sum

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `np.einsum()` implements Einstein summation notation, allowing you to express complex array operations (dot products, outer products, transposes, traces) in a compact string notation.

```python
np.einsum('ij,jk->ik', A, B)  # Matrix multiplication
np.einsum('ii', A)             # Trace
np.einsum('ij->ji', A)         # Transpose
```

---

### Question 4 [Medium]
**How do you solve a system of linear equations `Ax = b`?**

A) `np.solve(A, b)`
B) `np.linalg.solve(A, b)`
C) `A.inverse() @ b`
D) Both A and B

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `np.linalg.solve(A, b)` solves the system `Ax = b`. Note that `np.solve` is not a real function — calling it raises an `AttributeError`. Using the inverse (`A.inverse() @ b`) is numerically less stable and slower for large systems, and `A.inverse()` is not a valid NumPy method either.

---

### Question 5 [Hard]
**What is the purpose of `np strides`?**

A) To calculate the speed of operations
B) To define how many bytes to skip in memory for each dimension
C) To set iteration speed
D) To configure array alignment

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Strides define how many bytes to move in memory for each index step in a dimension. Understanding strides helps optimize memory access patterns and explains why some views are faster than others.

---

### Question 6 [Medium]
**Which function computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix?**

A) `np.linalg.eig()`
B) `np.linalg.eigen()`
C) `np.eigvals()`
D) Both A and C

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** `np.linalg.eig()` returns both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. `np.linalg.eigvals()` returns only eigenvalues. Use `eigvals()` when you only need eigenvalues for better performance.

---

### Question 7 [Hard]
**What is the difference between `np.dot()` and `@` operator?**

A) No difference for 2D arrays
B) `@` is always faster
C) `np.dot()` supports higher dimensions
D) Both A and C

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** For 2D arrays, `np.dot(A, B)` and `A @ B` are equivalent. `@` is the matrix multiplication operator (PEP 465). `np.dot()` supports higher-dimensional arrays with specific broadcasting rules.

---

### Question 8 [Medium]
**How do you compute the singular value decomposition (SVD)?**

A) `np.linalg.svd()`
B) `np.svd()`
C) `np.linalg.singular()`
D) SVD is not available in NumPy

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `np.linalg.svd()` returns the SVD of a matrix: U, S (singular values), and Vh. SVD is fundamental in dimensionality reduction, data compression, and solving least-squares problems.

---

### Question 9 [Hard]
**What is `np.memmap` used for?**

A) Memory mapping files for array storage
B) Creating memory-efficient arrays
C) Both A and B
D) Mapping memory addresses

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** `np.memmap` creates a NumPy array backed by a memory-mapped file. This allows working with arrays larger than RAM by loading only needed portions from disk.

---

### Question 10 [Medium]
**Which random distribution follows a bell curve?**

A) `np.random.uniform()`
B) `np.random.normal()`
C) `np.random.poisson()`
D) `np.random.binomial()`

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** `np.random.normal(loc, scale, size)` generates samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution, which follows the classic bell curve. `loc` is mean, `scale` is standard deviation.

---

### Question 11 [Hard]
**What does `np.ufunc` represent?**

A) Universal functions for element-wise operations
B) User-defined functions
C) Utility functions
D) Union functions

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Universal functions (ufuncs) are NumPy functions that perform element-wise operations on arrays. They are implemented in C for speed and support broadcasting, type casting, and output parameters.

---

### Question 12 [Medium]
**How do you compute the Fourier transform of an array?**

A) `np.fft.fft()`
B) `np.transform()`
C) `np.fourier()`
D) `np.fft.transform()`

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `np.fft.fft()` computes the 1D Fast Fourier Transform. Related functions include `ifft()` (inverse), `fft2()` (2D), and `fftn()` (N-dimensional).

---

### Question 13 [Hard]
**What is the purpose of `np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided()`?**

A) Creates views with custom strides
B) Changes array strides automatically
C) Optimizes stride calculations
D) Creates strided arrays

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `as_strided()` creates a view of an array with custom strides. This is useful for implementing sliding window operations, im2col transformations, and other array manipulations without copying data.

---

### Question 14 [Medium]
**Which function computes the determinant of a matrix?**

A) `np.linalg.det()`
B) `np.linalg.determinant()`
C) `np.det()`
D) `np.matrix.det()`

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `np.linalg.det()` computes the determinant of a square matrix. The determinant is used in matrix inversion, solving linear systems, and checking if a matrix is singular.

---

### Question 15 [Hard]
**What is "vectorization" in NumPy?**

A) Converting code to use vectors
B) Replacing explicit loops with array operations
C) Using SIMD instructions
D) Both B and C

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Vectorization replaces Python loops with NumPy array operations, which are implemented in optimized C code. This leverages CPU SIMD instructions for massive performance gains.

---

### Question 16 [Medium]
**How do you compute the cross product of two vectors?**

A) `np.cross()`
B) `np.dot()`
C) `np.outer()`
D) `np.multiply()`

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `np.cross(a, b)` computes the cross product of two vectors. The cross product is perpendicular to both input vectors and is used in physics, 3D graphics, and geometry.

---

### Question 17 [Hard]
**What is the purpose of `np.fromfunction()`?**

A) Creates arrays by evaluating a function at each coordinate
B) Imports functions from other modules
C) Converts functions to arrays
D) Creates function objects

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** `np.fromfunction()` creates an array where each element is computed by calling a function with the coordinates. Useful for creating arrays with specific patterns.

```python
np.fromfunction(lambda i, j: i + j, (3, 3))
# [[0, 1, 2],
#  [1, 2, 3],
#  [2, 3, 4]]
```

---

### Question 18 [Hard]
**What happens when you do `arr.flags.writeable = False`?**

A) The array becomes immutable
B) Raises an error if you try to modify
C) Both A and B
D) Only prevents deletion

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Setting `writeable=False` makes the array read-only. Any attempt to modify it raises a `ValueError`. This is useful for ensuring data integrity and enabling certain optimizations.

---

### Question 19 [Medium]
**How do you stack arrays vertically?**

A) `np.vstack()`
B) `np.concatenate()` with axis=0
C) `np.r_[]`
D) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** All three methods stack arrays vertically. `vstack()` and `np.r_[]` are syntactic sugar for `concatenate` with `axis=0`.

---

### Question 20 [Hard]
**What is `np.tensordot()` used for?**

A) Dot product along specified axes
B) Tensor multiplication
C) Both A and B
D) Computing tensor norms

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** `np.tensordot(a, b, axes)` computes the dot product along specified axes. It generalizes matrix multiplication to higher-dimensional arrays and is flexible for tensor operations.
