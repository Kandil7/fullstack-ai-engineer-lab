## How to Use for Interview Prep

### Recommended Study Order

```
1. Python Libraries Interview (Foundation)
   └── Builds NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib skills needed everywhere

2. FastAPI Interview (Backend)
   └── Applies Python skills to web development

3. Machine Learning Interview (AI/ML)
   └── Uses libraries for algorithm implementation
```

### Study Strategy

**Week 1: Foundation**
- [ ] Complete Python Libraries Interview (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Practice all coding challenges with a timer (15 min each)
- [ ] Review NumPy and Pandas thoroughly

**Week 2: Backend**
- [ ] Complete FastAPI Interview (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Build a sample API project from scratch
- [ ] Practice explaining dependency injection clearly

**Week 3: ML/AI**
- [ ] Complete Machine Learning Interview (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Implement algorithms from scratch (not just sklearn)
- [ ] Practice explaining bias-variance tradeoff

**Week 4: Mock Interviews**
- [ ] Set a 45-minute timer
- [ ] Pick 3 random questions from each file
- [ ] Explain answers out loud as if in an interview
- [ ] Review missed concepts

## Tips for Technical Interviews

### Before the Interview

1. **Know Your Fundamentals**
   - Python data structures and their Big-O complexity
   - HTTP methods and status codes
   - Basic statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation)

2. **Prepare Your Environment**
   - Have Python 3.10+ installed
   - Know your IDE shortcuts (VS Code, PyCharm)
   - Test your microphone and camera for remote interviews

3. **Review Company Tech Stack**
   - Check their job description for required libraries
   - Look at their GitHub for code patterns
   - Read their engineering blog if available

### During the Interview

1. **Clarify Before Coding**
   - "What are the input constraints?"
   - "Should I handle edge cases like empty inputs?"
   - "Is the data sorted or unsorted?"

2. **Think Out Loud**
   - Explain your approach before writing code
   - Mention tradeoffs (time vs space complexity)
   - Acknowledge if you're unsure about something

3. **Structure Your Code**
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add type hints in Python
   - Include docstrings for functions
   - Handle errors gracefully

4. **Test Your Solution**
   - Walk through examples manually
   - Consider edge cases (empty, null, single element)
   - Mention time and space complexity

### Common Interview Formats

| Format | Duration | What They Assess |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Whiteboard/Coding | 45-60 min | Problem-solving, coding skills |
| System Design | 60-90 min | Architecture, scalability |
| Behavioral | 30-45 min | Culture fit, past experience |
| Take-Home Project | 2-8 hours | Code quality, completeness |

## Quick Reference: Key Concepts

### Python Essentials

```python
# List comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# Dictionary comprehension
word_lengths = {w: len(w) for w in words}

# Generator expression
sum_of_squares = sum(x**2 for x in range(1000000))

# Lambda functions
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda w: len(w))
```

### NumPy Essentials

```python
import numpy as np

# Array operations
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
mean = np.mean(arr)
std = np.std(arr)
normalized = (arr - arr.mean()) / arr.std()
```

### FastAPI Essentials

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return {"item": item, "status": "created"}
```

### Machine Learning Essentials

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
```
