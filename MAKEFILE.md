# Makefile Reference

This repo targets **Windows/PowerShell**, so automation lives in `infra/scripts/*.ps1` rather
than a Makefile. This document is the comprehensive reference for every command and operation
available in the workspace.

> **Prerequisites:** PowerShell 5.1+, Go 1.22+, Docker Desktop (optional), Pester 5+
> (`Install-Module Pester -Scope CurrentUser`).

## Infrastructure Commands

### Start Local Infrastructure

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Brings up PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), and Qdrant (6333) in the background. All data
persists in Docker volumes between restarts. Use this at the start of every work session.

**When to use:** First thing each day, or after a `docker compose down`.

---

### Start Infrastructure with Dev Tools

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml --profile dev-tools up -d
```

Same as above but also starts PgAdmin (5050), Redis Commander (8081), and the Qdrant
dashboard. Useful for visual database inspection.

**When to use:** Debugging data issues, inspecting vector collections, or verifying schema.

---

### Stop Infrastructure

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

Stops all containers but preserves data volumes. Safe to run repeatedly.

---

### Stop and Remove All Data

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

Stops containers AND deletes all volumes. This is a full reset — all data is lost.

**When to use:** Starting fresh, fixing corrupted state, or after a failed migration.

---

### Restart a Specific Service

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml restart postgres
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml restart redis
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml restart qdrant
```

Restarts a single container without affecting others. Data is preserved.

---

### View Container Logs

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f postgres
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f redis
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f qdrant
```

Follows logs in real-time. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. Omit `-f` for non-following output.

---

### Check Container Health

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml ps
```

Shows running status and health check state for all services. All three core services should
show `healthy` before proceeding with development.

---

### Database Migrations

```powershell
# Apply migrations (when migration files exist in projects/03-databases/postgres-design/)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U fslab -d fslab -f projects/03-databases/postgres-design/migrations/001_init.sql

# Or via Docker
docker exec -i fslab-postgres psql -U fslab -d fslab < projects/03-databases/postgres-design/migrations/001_init.sql
```

Run SQL migration files against the local PostgreSQL instance. Always back up data before
running destructive migrations.

**When to use:** After schema changes, new table creation, or index updates.

---

### Redis Cache Management

```powershell
# Flush all Redis data
docker exec fslab-redis redis-cli FLUSHALL

# Flush only the current database
docker exec fslab-redis redis-cli FLUSHDB

# Check Redis memory usage
docker exec fslab-redis redis-cli INFO memory
```

**When to use:** After changing cache key patterns, fixing stale data, or debugging cache
misses.

---

### Qdrant Vector DB Setup

```powershell
# List all collections
curl http://localhost:6333/collections

# Check collection info
curl http://localhost:6333/collections/educational_content

# Delete a collection (destructive)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:6333/collections/educational_content
```

**When to use:** After re-embedding content, changing vector dimensions, or debugging
retrieval quality.

---

## Development Commands

### Run Auth Service Locally

```powershell
cd projects/01-backend-go/01-auth-service
go run .
```

Starts the Go auth service on its default port. Requires PostgreSQL to be running.

**When to use:** Developing or testing authentication features.

---

### Run Auth Service with Hot Reload

**When to use:** Before committing, during development, or after fixing a bug.

---

### Generate New ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

```powershell
