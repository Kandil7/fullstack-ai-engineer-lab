## The rule that matters most

> **Read the chapter after you've built the thing, not before.**

Reading first produces recognition; building first produces questions, and the chapter then
answers questions you actually have. This inverts the usual course-then-project order and is
the single highest-leverage change to how the material is consumed.

Corollary: **reaching for an additional source "to be sure you understood" is a procrastination
signal.** The list below is sufficient. Go back to the code.

## Books

### Tier 1 — read fully

**AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models** — Chip Huyen (2025)

The single most relevant book for this target role. Written for AI engineers rather than data
scientists: RAG, fine-tuning, evaluation, agents, deployment. If only one book is read, this
is it.

*Use:* one chapter per phase of the active track, after that phase's building is done.
Chapters 1–3 in week 1; the RAG chapter in weeks 2–3; evaluation and agents in weeks 5–7.

### Tier 2 — read the relevant parts

**The LLM Engineering Handbook** — Paul Iusztin & Maxime Labonne

Bridges ML theory and production systems. More hands-on than Huyen: RAG, vector databases,
evaluation, deployment, observability, optimization. *Use:* weeks 7–8, during hardening.

**Designing Machine Learning Systems** — Chip Huyen (2022)

System-level thinking — data engineering, feature engineering, deployment, monitoring, A/B
testing. Closes the gap between "can build a model" and "can build a system." *Use:*
post-employment, or when system-design interviews start surfacing gaps.

### Tier 3 — reference

**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** — Aurélien Géron

The standard practical ML text; every chapter has working code. *Use:* reference during the
deferred ML sprint (week 11+), not cover-to-cover.

**Natural Language Processing with Transformers** — Tunstall, von Werra, Wolf

By the Hugging Face team. Deep, practical treatment of transformers and fine-tuning. *Use:*
when attention internals or fine-tuning become necessary.

**Designing Data-Intensive Applications** — Martin Kleppmann

Not AI-specific and essential anyway: databases, distributed systems, message queues. *Use:*
selected chapters, post-employment.

**Deep Learning** — Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville — free at deeplearningbook.org

The academic reference. Harder than everything above; the strongest mathematical foundation
available. *Use:* only if going deep into research-adjacent work.

**Mathematics for Machine Learning** — Deisenroth, Faisal, Ong — free at mml-book.github.io

Scoped to the mathematics actually used in ML. *Use:* to close a specific gap.

## Courses

### For the active track

| Course | Covers | Week |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DeepLearning.AI — ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers | prompting fundamentals (~1h) | 1 |
| DeepLearning.AI — Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG | RAG + evaluation (~1.5h) | 2–3 |
| Activeloop RAG courses | chunking, retrieval optimization — deepest free RAG material | 2–3 |
| **Hugging Face Agents Course** | agents end-to-end; free certificate | 5–6 |
| Docker Curriculum (docker-curriculum.com) | containerization | 4 |

DeepLearning.AI short courses are the best tool available for closing one specific gap
quickly — each is 1–2 hours and single-topic.

### Documentation (primary sources — prefer these)

| Topic | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Claude API | docs.claude.com |
| FastAPI | fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial — sufficient on its own; don't look for alternatives |
| Qdrant | qdrant.tech/documentation |
| LangGraph | official docs |
| MCP | modelcontextprotocol.io |
| RAGAS | docs.ragas.io |
| Langfuse | langfuse.com/docs |
| Sentence Transformers | Hugging Face docs |
| pytest | official docs — fixtures and mocking sections only |
| Prompt engineering | promptingguide.ai |

### For the deferred ML sprint

Google ML Crash Course · fast.ai · Karpathy "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" ·
Hugging Face NLP Course · *The Illustrated Transformer* (Alammar).

### Certificates — optional

**IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate** (Coursera) — transformers, fine-tuning
(LoRA/QLoRA, RLHF), RAG, LangChain across 7 courses, ending in a QA bot. Theory-heavy;
~48 hours over 3 months.

**DataCamp Associate AI Engineer** — deliberately avoids advanced mathematics, focused on
building LLM applications.

Neither is necessary. Portfolio and demonstrated work outweigh certificates for the roles
being targeted, particularly at startups.
