## Assessment principle

**A level requires evidence — a file path, a passing test, a deployed URL.** Study without a
shipped artifact caps a skill at level 3 ("can use with documentation"), no matter how much
material was covered. This is why several rows below show a large gap between the volume of
material studied and the level assigned.

## Active-track skills

Targets are the level needed to interview credibly for a remote AI engineer role.

| Skill | Target | Current | Evidence | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python (language) | 7 | **6** | `python/01-core-python/` (41 topics), `02-advanced-python/` (20 topics) | Apply in a real service, not exercises |
| Python (production) | 7 | **3** | — | DevMate: packaging, config, logging, error handling — week 0 |
| Clean code / typing | 6 | **4** | lectures exist; no CI enforcement | ruff + mypy green in CI — week 0 |
| Testing (pytest) | 6 | **4** | `python/tests/`, `02-advanced-python/18-unit-testing.py` | Test a real service; LLM-aware testing — week 7 |
| Git | 7 | **4** | 25+ commits, 3 PRs | Rebase, conflict resolution, 5 clean PRs — week 0 |
| **CI/CD** | 6 | **1** | none | GitHub Actions green — week 0 |
| FastAPI | 7 | **4** | `05-web-frameworks/fastapi/` (25 topics + exercises) | Ship a real API — week 4 |
| LLM APIs | 7 | **2** | curriculum only | Streaming, structured outputs, retries — week 1 |
| Prompt engineering | 7 | **3** | `04-ai-engineering/ai-automation/02-prompt-engineering.py` | Versioned templates in a running system — week 1 |
| **Observability** | 6 | **1** | none | Langfuse + cost tracking — week 1 |
| Embeddings | 6 | **2** | curriculum only | Real corpus, measured — week 2 |
| Chunking | 7 | **2** | curriculum only | 3 strategies compared on a golden set — week 2 |
| Vector DB (Qdrant) | 7 | **2** | cheat-sheet, compose service | Ingest and query at scale — week 2 |
| RAG (end-to-end) | 8 | **2** | 835 lines of exercise code, nothing running | Working pipeline with metrics — weeks 2–3 |
| **Evaluation** | 7 | **1** | `evaluations/` scaffolded, empty | Golden set + RAGAS — week 2 |
| **SQL** | 6 | **2** | `04-databases/mysql/` (sqlite-based) | Real schema, indexes, query plans — week 4 |
| Docker | 6 | **2** | compose exists; cheat-sheet | Multi-stage build, deploy — week 4 |
| Deployment | 6 | **1** | none | Public URL — week 4 |
| Agents | 7 | **2** | 10 exercises + lectures, nothing running | 4 tools, ReAct, step caps — weeks 5–6 |
| **MCP** | 6 | **1** | mentioned in 2 quizzes | Build an MCP server — week 6 |
| Caching (Redis) | 5 | **1** | compose service only | Semantic cache with hit rate — week 7 |
| Guardrails / security | 6 | **2** | 10 security exercises | Block real injection attempts — week 7 |
| System design | 6 | **3** | 2 design docs, 5 ADRs | Explain DevMate's architecture cold — week 8 |
| Technical English | 7 | **4** | repo docs in English | Recorded explanations, mocks — week 8 |

### Reading this table

The pattern is consistent: **curriculum-level exposure (2) with production-level targets
(6–8)**. That gap is not a knowledge problem — the material has been covered in depth. It is
an evidence problem, and the active track is structured to close it week by week.

Rows in **bold** are at level 1 — genuinely untouched, not merely unapplied.

## Long-track skills (deferred)

| Skill | Target | Current | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Go | 6 | 2 | Deferred — 2 exercise scaffolds, auth-service incomplete |
| PostgreSQL (depth) | 6 | 2 | Partial — week 4 SQL sprint covers the basics |
| Flutter | 6 | 1 | Deferred |
| Next.js | 6 | 1 | Deferred |
| ML fundamentals | 5 | 2 | Deferred to week 11+ (A10) |
| PyTorch | 4 | 1 | Deferred to week 11+ (A10) |
| Kubernetes | 3 | 1 | Post-employment |

## Level definitions

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Aware — know what it is, no hands-on |
| 2 | Exposure — completed tutorials or exercises, nothing shipped |
| 3 | Basic — can use with documentation open |
| 4 | Working — can build simple things independently |
| 5 | Working+ — can build moderate features and debug them |
| 6 | Intermediate — can architect solutions and handle edge cases |
| 7 | Advanced — can teach it, optimize it, defend design choices |
| 8 | Expert — production-grade mastery, performance tuning |
| 9 | Specialist — deep expertise, contributes to the ecosystem |
| 10 | Authority — recognized expert, shapes best practice |

## Monthly review check

1. Update `Current` — **only with evidence**; a path, a test, or a URL.
2. Verify every `Evidence` path still exists.
3. Refresh `Next step` for anything completed.
4. Flag any active-track skill more than 3 levels below target at its scheduled week.
5. Re-audit against [`../reference/python-ai-engineer-checklist.md`](../reference/python-ai-engineer-checklist.md).
