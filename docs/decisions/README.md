# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture **why** a decision was made, the options considered, and the consequences. They are
the architectural memory of the workspace. New ADRs are created with `infra/scripts/new-adr.ps1`.

```

Or manually:
1. Copy `templates/adr.template.md` to `docs/decisions/NNNN-kebab-title.md`
2. Fill in context, options, decision, and consequences
3. Add to this index table
4. Update `registries/decision-log.yaml`
