# Learning Path: System Design

**Last updated:** 2026-06-26

**Goal:** develop the ability to design scalable, reliable distributed systems — covering
architecture patterns, infrastructure components, and real-world case studies.

**Primary project:** `projects/05-system-design`

---

## Milestones

### 1. Designing for Scale (Week 1)
- Vertical vs horizontal scaling — when each makes sense
- Stateful vs stateless services — why stateless scales easier
- The CAP theorem: consistency, availability, partition tolerance tradeoffs
- PACELC: extending CAP with latency considerations
- SLAs, SLOs, SLIs: defining reliability mathematically
- Capacity estimation: back-of-envelope calculations for QPS, storage, bandwidth

### 2. Load Balancing (Week 1–2)
- **L4 load balancing:** TCP-level, fast, limited routing logic
  - HAProxy, AWS NLB, LVS
- **L7 load balancing:** HTTP-level, content-aware routing
  - NGINX, AWS ALB, Envoy
- Algorithms: round-robin, weighted, least-connections, consistent hashing, IP hash
- Health checks: active vs passive, critical for zero-downtime deploys
- Global load balancing: DNS-based, GeoDNS, Anycast
- Sticky sessions: why they exist, why to avoid them

### 3. Caching (Week 2)
- **Client-side caching:** browser cache headers, ETags, Cache-Control
- **CDN caching:** CloudFront, Cloudflare — edge caching for static + dynamic
- **Application caching:** in-process (LRU), Redis, Memcached
- Cache patterns:
  - **Cache-aside:** app checks cache → miss → DB → populate cache
  - **Read-through:** cache fetches from DB on miss
  - **Write-through:** writes go to cache and DB simultaneously
  - **Write-behind:** writes go to cache, async flush to DB
- Cache invalidation: TTL-based, event-based, versioned keys
- Cache stampede: thundering herd problem, lock-and-rebuild, probabilistic early expiry
- Redis data structures: strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams

### 4. Message Queues (Week 2–3)
- **Why queues:** decouple producers/consumers, handle traffic spikes, async processing
- **RabbitMQ:** traditional broker, exchanges, routing keys, ack/nack
- **Apache Kafka:** distributed log, partitions, consumer groups, offset management
- **Redis Streams:** lightweight alternative, consumer groups, trimming
- Delivery semantics: at-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once
- Dead letter queues: handling poison messages
- Schema evolution: Avro, Protobuf, schema registry
- Ordering guarantees: per-partition vs global

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture (Week 3)
- Events vs commands vs queries — different message types
- **Event sourcing:** store events, derive state, full audit trail
- **CQRS:** separate read and write models
  - When to use: read-heavy systems, complex domain logic
  - Tradeoffs: eventual consistency, operational complexity
- **Saga pattern:** distributed transactions without 2PC
  - Choreography: services emit and listen to events
  - Orchestration: central coordinator manages the flow
- Idempotency: making operations safe to retry
- Eventual consistency: embracing it vs fighting it

### 6. Microservices Patterns (Week 3–4)
- **Service decomposition:** bounded contexts, domain-driven design
- **API Gateway:** single entry point, routing, rate limiting, auth
  - Kong, AWS API Gateway, Envoy
- **Service mesh:** Istio, Linkerd — sidecar proxy for inter-service communication
- **Circuit breaker:** Hystrix pattern — fail fast, prevent cascade failures
- **Bulkhead:** isolate failures to one service, not the entire system
- **Strangler fig:** gradual migration from monolith to microservices
- Observability: distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin), structured logging, metrics (Prometheus)

### 7. Database Design for Scale (Week 4)
- **Replication:** primary-replica, read replicas, multi-primary
- **Sharding:** horizontal partitioning — hash-based, range-based, directory-based
  - Challenges: cross-shard queries, rebalancing, hotspots
- **Partitioning:** PostgreSQL table partitioning by range/list/hash
- **Polyglot persistence:** right tool for right job
  - PostgreSQL for transactional data
  - Qdrant for vector search
  - Redis for caching/sessions
  - S3 for object storage
- Indexing strategies: B-tree, hash, GIN, GiST, partial indexes
- Connection pooling: PgBouncer, HikariCP

### 8. Case Studies (Week 5–6)

#### ChatGPT / LLM Inference Service
- Request flow: API → load balancer → inference scheduler → GPU pool
- KV-cache management for long conversations
- Streaming responses: SSE, chunked transfer encoding
- Rate limiting: per-user, per-organization, tiered
- Cost optimization: model routing (cheap model for simple queries)
- Caching: prompt caching, semantic deduplication

#### WhatsApp / Real-time Messaging
- Connection management: WebSocket farms, connection persistence
- Message ordering: Lamport clocks, vector clocks
- End-to-end encryption: key exchange, forward secrecy
- Group messaging: fan-out on write vs fan-out on read
- Media handling: upload to CDN, thumbnail generation, lazy loading
- Online status: heartbeat, presence service, tradeoffs of accuracy vs cost

#### Coursera / Learning Platform
- Video delivery: transcoding pipeline, adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS/DASH)
- Progress tracking: event sourcing, idempotent checkpoints
- Recommendation engine: collaborative filtering + content-based
- Assessment system: quiz engine, plagiarism detection, auto-grading
- Certificate generation: event-driven pipeline, PDF generation at scale

### 9. Infrastructure & Deployment (Week 6–7)
- **Docker:** containers, Dockerfile best practices, multi-stage builds
- **Kubernetes:** pods, deployments, services, ingress, configmaps
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, deployment pipelines, blue-green vs canary
- **Observability stack:** Prometheus (metrics) + Grafana (dashboards) + Loki (logs)
- **Alerting:** PagerDuty, OpsGenie, alert fatigue avoidance
- **Disaster recovery:** RPO, RTO, backup strategies, chaos engineering

|---|---|
| Back-of-envelope estimation | Grounds design in reality, not hand-waving |
| Statelessness | Enables horizontal scaling without session complexity |
| Cache-aside pattern | Covers 90% of caching use cases |

## Design Framework (for interview or practice)

1. **Requirements:** functional + non-functional (latency, throughput, availability)
2. **Estimation:** QPS, storage, bandwidth — order of magnitude
3. **High-level design:** boxes and arrows, major components
4. **Deep dive:** pick 2-3 components, detail the internals
5. **Bottlenecks:** identify failure modes, single points of failure
6. **Tradeoffs:** explicitly state what you chose and why

## Daily Pattern

1h reading (paper, blog, case study) → 2h design exercise (whiteboard/diagram) → 1h implement
one component → 1h discuss/review with peer or AI.

## Architecture Patterns Reference

### Caching Layers

```
Client Browser (Cache-Control, ETags)
    ↓
CDN (CloudFront / Cloudflare)
    ↓
API Gateway (rate limit, auth)
    ↓
Application Cache (Redis)
    ↓
Database (PostgreSQL with read replicas)
    ↓
Object Storage (S3 for blobs)
```

### Message Queue Patterns

```
Producer → Queue → Consumer (point-to-point)
Producer → Exchange → Queue(s) → Consumer(s) (pub/sub with routing)
Producer → Topic Partition → Consumer Group (Kafka)
```

### Microservice Communication

```
Synchronous:  Service A → HTTP/gRPC → Service B (blocks until response)
Asynchronous: Service A → Queue → Service B (fire and forget)
Event-driven:  Service A → Event Bus → Service B, C, D (pub/sub)
```

### Load Balancing Algorithms

| Algorithm | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Round Robin | Cycle through servers | Equal-capacity servers |
| Weighted RR | More requests to powerful servers | Heterogeneous hardware |
| Least Connections | Route to least busy server | Variable request durations |
| Consistent Hash | Hash key maps to server | Session affinity, caching |
| IP Hash | Hash client IP | Sticky sessions (avoid if possible) |

### Case Study: ChatGPT Architecture

```
User Request
    ↓
API Gateway (rate limit, auth, routing)
    ↓
Load Balancer
    ↓
Inference Router
├─ Simple query → Smaller model (GPT-4o-mini)
├─ Complex query → Larger model (GPT-4o)
└─ Code query → Specialized model
    ↓
GPU Pool (A100/H100)
├─ KV-Cache management (reuse across turns)
├─ Speculative decoding (parallel draft + verify)
└─ Continuous batching (maximize GPU utilization)
    ↓
Streaming Response (SSE)
    ↓
Response Cache (semantic deduplication)
```

### Capacity Estimation Formula

```
Daily Active Users (DAU):     1,000,000
Requests per user per day:    10
Total requests per day:       10,000,000
Peak QPS (10x average):      ~1,200 QPS
Average QPS:                  ~115 QPS

Storage per user:             1 KB metadata
Total metadata:               1 GB
Message history:              100 KB/user → 100 GB

Bandwidth:                    1,200 req/s × 10 KB avg = 12 MB/s
```

### Circuit Breaker States

```
Closed (normal)
├─ Request passes through
├─ Track failure count
└─ If failures > threshold → Open

Open (failing)
├─ Requests fail immediately (no call to downstream)
├─ Start timer
└─ After timeout → Half-Open

Half-Open (testing)
├─ Allow one probe request
├─ If success → Closed
└─ If failure → Open
```

### Database Scaling Decision Tree

```
Read-heavy or write-heavy?
├─ Read-heavy → Read replicas + caching
├─ Write-heavy → Sharding or partitioning
└─ Both → Consider CQRS

Single database handling load?
├─ < 10K QPS → Optimized single DB + cache
├─ 10K-100K QPS → Read replicas + connection pooling
├─ 100K+ QPS → Sharding + dedicated cache layer
└─ Global → Multi-region with conflict resolution
```

  name: auth-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
