# Feature Priorities

## Overview

This document defines the priority matrix for features in the Full-Stack AI Engineer Lab. Features are categorized into four priority levels (P0-P3) based on their impact on learning, project execution, and workspace quality.

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Description | Timeline | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **P0** | Critical — blocks core workflows | Immediate | Must be complete before any P1 work |
| **P1** | Important — enables primary learning | Weeks 1-4 | Required for meaningful progress |
| **P2** | Useful — improves efficiency | Weeks 5-8 | Enhances existing workflows |
| **P3** | Nice-to-have — advanced capabilities | Weeks 9-12 | Optional but valuable |

## Trade-offs

### Speed vs. Completeness
- **P0**: Prioritize completeness — these features are foundational
- **P1**: Balance speed and completeness — these enable learning
- **P2**: Prioritize speed — these improve efficiency
- **P3**: Prioritize exploration — these are experimental

### Scope vs. Quality
- **All priorities**: Quality is non-negotiable for P0 and P1
- **P2-P3**: Acceptable to ship with known limitations
- **Documentation**: Required for P0 and P1; optional for P2-P3

### Learning vs. Shipping
- **P0-P1**: Learning is primary; shipping is secondary
- **P2-P3**: Balance learning with practical utility
- **Overall**: This repo is for learning, not shipping products
