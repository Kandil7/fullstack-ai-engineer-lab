A **Repo-Centric Agentic Workspace** — a learning + execution + review operating system for
becoming a production-level Full-Stack AI Engineer. This is not a notes folder; it is an
engineering environment where prompts, templates, workflows, ADRs, and reviews are
versioned **engineering artifacts**.

> The "agents" here are **prompted operating modes** (markdown under `.ai/`), not runtime
> processes. Orchestration is human-led and workflow-driven.

## Learning Strategy

**Write code yourself first**, then use AI as assistant — not replacement.

- **70% build** / 20% review / 10% theory
- Use AI for: quick explanations, code review, architecture hints, boilerplate
- Don't use AI for: writing entire systems you can't explain
- Every feature flows: `plan → design → build → review → fix → reflect`
- **Golden rule:** if you can't explain the code an hour later, AI wrote it for you, not with you

See [`docs/product/learning-strategy.md`](docs/product/learning-strategy.md) for the complete 5-axis resource system.
See [`docs/product/ai-learning-operating-manual.md`](docs/product/ai-learning-operating-manual.md) for the complete AI agent usage guide.

## Code Intelligence

Four-layer code intelligence for token-efficient, context-aware engineering:

| Layer | Tool | What it does | Stats |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| **Structural Graph** | codebase-memory-mcp | Tree-sitter + LSP call graph, 155 languages | 53,218 nodes, 125,174 edges |
| **Review Graph** | code-review-graph | PR blast-radius, community detection, impact analysis | 11,590 nodes, 87,721 edges, 23 communities |
| **Multimodal Graph** | graphify | Code + docs + schemas, god nodes, shortest path | 49,856 nodes, 54,483 edges, 2,833 communities |
| **Context Pack** | repomix | One-shot repo packing for ad-hoc LLM tasks | 1,244,995 tokens, 1,082 files |

**Quick commands:**
```text
Who calls X?        → codebase-memory trace_path --function_name X --direction inbound
Find by pattern     → codebase-memory search_graph --name_pattern ".*X.*"
Impact of changes   → codebase-memory detect_changes
Blast radius        → code-review-graph detect_changes_tool
God nodes           → graphify god_nodes
Pack for LLM        → repomix pack_codebase
```

## Workflow Rules

1. **Plan before build.** Start every feature at `.ai/workflows/feature/01-plan.md`.
2. **Architecture before large implementation.** Touching system boundaries → ADR or architecture review is mandatory.
3. **Review before done.** No feature is complete without `ai-review.md`.
4. **Document every bug** in a debugging-session artifact.
5. **Deterministic paths.** Artifacts land where the workflow says — no ad-hoc locations.
6. **Registries are source of truth** for prompt/workflow/template inventory and versions.

## Daily Loop (5+ hours)

| Block  | Time | Activity                                      |
| ------ | ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Build  | 3h   | The week's deliverable — code first            |
| Learn  | 1h   | One topic, docs-first, **after** building it   |
| Review | 1h   | AI code review + debugging log                 |
| Recall | 30m  | Explain without notes + daily log + plan       |

## Active Plan

**[Active Track — 10-Week AI Engineer](docs/roadmap/active-track-10-week.md)** — adopted
2026-08-02 by [ADR-0004](docs/decisions/0004-adopt-10-week-ai-engineer-track.md).
Target: a remote AI/LLM engineering role. Vehicle: **DevMate**.

> **Governing rule:** no new lecture, glossary, or quiz file until DevMate is deployed at a
> public URL. The repo holds 6,947 lines of AI teaching material and zero running AI services;
> that ratio has to invert.

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0 | A1 | CI green + `devmate stats` CLI |
| 1 | A2 | LLM layer — streaming, traced, costed |
| 2–3 | A3 | RAG with a measured eval harness |
| 4 | A4 | **Deployed at a public URL** + SQL sprint |
| 5–6 | A5 | Agent with 4 tools + MCP server |
| 7 | A6 | Cache, guardrails, hardening |
| 8 | A7 | Portfolio — blog, README, CV |
| 9–10 | A8, A9 | 40 applications, first interview |
| 11+ | A10 | Deferred ML sprint (buffer weeks) |

**Right now:** [`docs/tracking/current-focus.md`](docs/tracking/current-focus.md) ·
**Status:** [`docs/roadmap/progress-dashboard.md`](docs/roadmap/progress-dashboard.md)

### Other tracks

| Track | Status |
